This program is a basic database manager where you can add, edit and delete entries graphically.
The program is written mostly in C++ with some SQL commands to navegate the DB.
It consists of four tabs: the first one gets player's info, the second one team's info, the third 
uses some criteria to find certain players and display their stats and the forth is where the add,
edit and delete options are availabele.
